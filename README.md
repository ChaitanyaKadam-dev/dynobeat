# dynobeat

A new Flutter project.

This project involves the development of an AI-based Flutter music player app that incorporates the
use of Amazon Web Services (AWS), Firebase, and ALAN Voice API. The app utilizes Flutter's
cross-platform development framework to create a user-friendly interface that allows users to listen to
and manage their music library. The integration of AWS provides cloud-based storage for music files,
while Firebase serves as the backend for user authentication and data storage. ALAN Voice AI
allows for voice-controlled commands, adding an innovative and convenient feature to the app.
